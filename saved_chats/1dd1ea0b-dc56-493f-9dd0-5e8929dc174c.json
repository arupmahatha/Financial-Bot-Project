This could be due to seasonality effects.\n\n- AC Wailea had several months where it significantly exceeded its EBITDA budget, with variances over $100k in some cases. Surfrider Malibu was more in line with its budget.\n\n- The largest negative variance for AC Wailea was around -$50k in July, while Surfrider Malibu had a -$80k variance in August.\n\nTo explain the major variances, we'd need to dig deeper into the revenue and expense line items for those specific months. Things like occupancy changes, ADR, labor costs, etc. could all be factors. But this query gives a high-level view of how the EBITDA margins trended vs. budget over the year.\n"
