Interpretation: The query retrieves the revenue generated by the hotel 'AC Wailea' in the year 2022. The result shows a revenue of $14,673,338.60.**\n\n**2. Insights/Trends: Since the query only returns a single revenue figure for one hotel in a specific year, it is difficult to identify any trends or make comparisons. However, the revenue figure itself provides insight into the financial performance of this particular hotel during 2022.**\n\n**3. Context: The revenue metric represents the total income generated by the hotel from its operations, including room bookings, food and beverage sales, and other services offered. It is a crucial indicator of a hotel's financial health and profitability. A high revenue figure suggests that the hotel had a successful year in terms of occupancy rates, average daily rates, and overall guest spending. However, to fully assess the hotel's performance, additional metrics such as expenses, profit margins, and occupancy rates would be needed.**\nIn summary, the query provides a snapshot of the revenue generated by the 'AC Wailea' hotel in 2022, which can be used as a baseline for comparison with other hotels or the same hotel's performance in different years. However, additional context and metrics would be required to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the hotel's overall financial performance and operational efficiency.\n\nüíª **SQL Query**:\n------------------------------\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(Current_Actual_Month) AS revenue\nFROM final_income_sheet_new_seq\nWHERE SQL_Property = 'AC Wailea'\n  AND strftime('%Y', Month) = '2022'\n  AND SQL_Account_Name = 'Revenue'\n  AND Sub_Account_Category_Order = 'Rooms';\n```"
